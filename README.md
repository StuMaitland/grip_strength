# Grip Strength Z-Score
Grip strength is associated with morbidity and mortality in older people. It is easy to measure and replicate. The normative values for grip strength vary by sex and age.

By using the <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/1602667">LMS method</a> with known normative values from a meta-analysis of 12 british grip strength studies, this tool calculates the z-score for an individual's grip strength. This enables interpretation of measurements as being at, above, or below expected values.

## Feedback
This is currently a quick web tool to encapsulate the LMS method. If needed this can be converted into an API or dedicated function
